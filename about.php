        <h2>What is the website for?</h2>

        <p>The website is to show my software development skills, as a technical portfolio. It's
            essentially just documentation for all my projects. It took me about 3 months to make
            as I developed for performance, functionality and with best practices in mind - not 
            because I needed to, but to show that I can. Here is a more detailed 
            <a href='documentation.php?project=Portfolio website'>breakdown of performance and how I 
            made the website</a>. Additionally, the website could be used as a reference for people
            intresting in making the projects I have made themselves.

        <p>Aspriring software engineer currently studying Mathematics BSc (Hons) at the Univeristy of Newcastle
            upon Tyne (2024-2027). After that, I wish to pursure a masters in applied mathematics. First year, 
            I got a high 1st (87%), with my best module being Python (93%) and I was ranked 2nd/127 (top 1.6%)
            in the class. For that, I was awarded the Reverend Gilbert Robinson scholarship, which is given to
            1 or 2 students of sufficient academic merit each year in the department.
