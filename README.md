# Portfolio website

This is where I display the documentation for all my projects, where I write a short article for each. It also acts as a technical portfolio / a virtual resume. 
I'm using this repository as version control for the code (PHP, JavaScript and CSS), but not to store any files (such as images, icons and JSON files). 
For this reason, running any of these files on your own computer will result in undesired and unexpected behaviour.
